Description
----------------------

BEWiS is a background modeling approach for videos based on a weightless neural system, 
namely WiSARD, with the aim of exploiting its features of being highly adaptive and 
noiseâ€“tolerance at runtime.
In BEWiS, the changing pixel colors in a video are processed by a an incremental 
learning neural network with a limited-in-time memory-retention mechanism that allow the
proposed system to absorb small variations of the learned model (background) 
in the steady state of operation as well as to  fastly adapt to background 
changes during the video timeline.
